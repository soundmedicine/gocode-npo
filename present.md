# Presentation Notes

1. Hi, this is my team. We're just four members of a larger full-stack web development team in the Galvanize immersion program.

2. As we browsed Colorado's databases for this weekend's challenge, we realized there are a lot of details out there about Colorado's non-profit organizations. 
    * Has anyone ever written a grant?
    * Has anyone ever spent time researching non-profit organizations to give to?
    
    * It's an intensive process, and going through all the information -- overhead, fundraising expenses, staff size, etc. -- can be discouraging. This is not what giving is about. Why do we make it so complicated? Is there a way we can streamline this process so donors and non-profits can cut to what really matters: mission and compatability.

3. We decided OUR mission would be to revolutionize this exhaustive process: GIVEMATCH APP.
    * It's an application oriented toward facilitating the relationship between donor-businesses and non-profit recipients.

    * The key is the GiveMatch Score:
        * Comparable apps like CharityNavigator rate non-profits based on the hard data -- revenue, expenses ...
        
        * We want GiveMatch to take it further:
            - What is unique about a GiveMatch score is that it's based not only on that tedious financial and administrative data (that's the easy part);

            - We also take the information that brings the possible relationship into relevance:
                + At first, the obvious. This is where more data comes in:

                    ## We married the following databases:
                        1. Charitable Purpose of the Charity in Colorado
                        2. Charity Filed Financial Information in Colorado
                        3. (Some Business database with industry and location info)
                    
                + Of course we use the financial data to illustrate what percentage of a non-profit's expenses is met by contributions.
                
                + What some may find less obvious is figuring out how to quantify compatibility:
                    - As a health care provider, I want to be linked to non-profits that make my job easier; so I'm connected to NPOs that improve health care education, fitness, or quality of life for my patients.

                    - As a real estate company, I want to contribute to a non-profit that brings more value to the communities in which my product market is, so I want to be linked to organizations in my region or area.
                
            - Now that our search for compatibility has been augmented by our data, our businesses can customize it further by adding to it:
                + As a business, I can include keywords to search non-profits who are also able to sign onto the app and add their own set of values that represent their organization.

                + On the other side, as a non-profit, I can update my record with what we call "ASKS":
                    - services or statistics they are prepared to offer donors that don't distract from our mission.

4. IN CLOSING ...
    We are so fortunate to have so much in Colorado. Tourism from all over the world brings in revenue for our businesses. As developers, we'd like our legacy to facilitate giving in a sustainable way. As we continue to develop this application, we'd like to make it available to both businesses and non-profits as a tool they can rely on to foster relationships, and more importantly, giving cycles that are motivated by connections deeper than monetary value. Giving should be easy. Let's make it that way.
